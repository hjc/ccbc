# Croscon Beer Club Round 6: [Bridge and Tunnel Brewery](http://bridgeandtunnelbrewery.com/wordpress1/) (11/18)

Pick some beer nuts, we're going in for round 7.

Our last venture was likely our greatest since Transmitter. KCBC did
everything but disappoint and contained some of the best brews we've ever
gotten to sample. With 9 beers on tap and not a single one disappointing
(special shoutout to Hipster Highway, the most drinkable beer I've had, and
their amazing Octoberfest), it's high up on the list for a revisit.

So, how do we top that?
