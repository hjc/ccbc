<strong>Croscon Beer Club Round 10: <a href="http://www.threesbrewing.com/">Three&#39;s Brewing</a> (02/24)<br /></strong><br /><br />Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow, which can only mean one thing: MORE BEER!<br /><br />On our last outing, we actually managed to make it to a TV Show! No joke! VICE<br />was filming a documentary on craft brewing and we were used for the background<br />shots. We had a HUGE variety of brews last time with a little bit for everyone<br />and ended our night with some Indian food.<br /><br />What are we gonna do this month, though?<br /><br /><strong>brew cask install croscon/beerclub/10</strong><br /><br />For our tenth trip, we&#39;re heading back to Brooklyn and right over to Gowanus<br />for <a href="http://www.threesbrewing.com/">Three&#39;s Brewing</a>! Three&#39;s probably<br />has my favorite description ever: &quot;At Threes Brewing we aspire to make beer<br />that's good, not just interesting or different.&quot; While we&#39;ve had some amazing<br />beers over our near year-long journey, some just felt like a cry for attention.<br />A simple, honest slogan like that brings a smile to my place. They&#39;re also just<br />as passionate about their space as they are their beer. In addition to having<br />an absolutely gorgeous looking bar and yard, they also stock food, wine, and<br />cocktails! Something for everyone!<br /><br />While I&#39;m not sure what their current tap includes, in the past they&#39;ve brewed<br />Wheats, Pale Ales, many an IPA, and even a Saison and Russian Imperial Stout.<br />It seems to be a varied menu with nothing too crazy on it. Food is provided by<br />The Meat Hook, a butchery in Williamsburg, and they even have coffee. The<br />liquor and wine &quot;reflects the breadth of their many interests&quot;, so it should be<br />at least&#8230; interesting. Oh, and it&#39;s Teacher Appreciation Day, so if you have<br />a teacher friend with a school ID&#8230; please bring. Cheap pitchers are awesome.<br /><br />Their space is absolutely huge and they&#39;re open until 2am (REJOICE)! But I&#39;d<br />still like to leave around <strong>5pm on Friday, February 24th</strong> in order to<br />catch their upstairs merchandise room which closes at 6. However, that&#39;s not<br />a hard requirement.<br /><br />It will take us 40 minutes to get their from the N or R train. As always,<br />everyone is welcome to come along and we highly encourage folks to join us.<br />Just tell them to meet us there!<br /><br /><strong>The Guest List</strong><br /><br /><ul><li>Hayden Chudy</li><li>Chris Gullian</li><li>Adam Heim</li><li>Adam Moore</li><li>Eli Gundry</li></ul><br /><strong>Additional Notes</strong><br /><br /><ul><li>BBCode for this one folks. I tried XML, but then I went to play with the</li>  Python API for it and noped out SUPER HARD.
<li>We&#39;re rendering with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bbcode/1.0.19">bbcode</a> and then using
    the same trick for CSS we used <br />with the HTML invite. Plus some manual tweaks...</li>
<li>Turns out, I had like&#8230; a WHOLE LIST of places to go, so we have PLENTY of</li>  breweries in the city to go to for next month.
<li>And to answer the question before it&#39;s asked: NOTHING will happen to Beer</li>  Club. No matter what happens, Beer Club will continue each month and I&#39;ll
<br />coordinate it or be damned. Even if that means I&#39;m GVCing into the next one
<br />from the top of a Nepalese Mountain.</ul>
