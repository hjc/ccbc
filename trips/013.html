<h1> Beer Club Round 13: <a href="http://www.otherhalfbrewing.com/info#hello">The Other Half</a> (5/19) </h1>
<p>Welcome to the first meeting of our new year!</p>
<p>Our New Year's Eve meetup was wonderful. While the turnout was lacking, the nachos and beer weren't, and there was a New Orleans style jazz/ska band. And some of the weirdest cartoons I've ever seen. Then we went to my apartment and played Jurassic Park II on the SNES (Pook's not that great) and Street Fighter II Turbo (he's also not great at that).</p>
<p>However, new month, new brewery. So, what's in store this time?</p>
<h2> brew cask install hjc/beerclub/13 </h2>
<p>For the first trip of our second year, we're gonna head back to Brooklyn, near where Folksbier was, for <a href="http://www.otherhalfbrewing.com/info#hello">Other Half Brewing</a>. Other Half is a young brewery founded in 2014 that makes limited release small batches of their beers. They do distribute draft to the local Brooklyn area, and sell cans and bottles on site (with really excellent designs). They have a big focus on IPA's, but make some pretty damn good ones (I've had the Flowerzz myself). They also have wonderful names, such as Meek Millet and Forgot About Drie. There' no food here, I can't find a shot of their tap room for the life of me, and I also don't know what's on tap (there will be lots of IPA's though). So... this one is kind of a gamble. </p>
<p>Luckily, it's not far out. It's located by Folksbier and should be a 35 minute train ride from the Chelsea area. Hell, if space becomes a problem, we can even relocate to Folksbier, as they were quite accommodating.</p>
<p>Their tasting room is open from 5pm to 10pm, so an arrival of 5:30pm to 6pm should be ideal. There's also some good food in this area for afterwards (including a Momofoku Milk Bar). Just hop on the F Train and get off at the Smith-9th St. station and you're there!</p>
<p>Not sure about reservations on this one, but if I get a good amount of RSVP's, I'll give it a shot. As always, anyone is welcome to join us!</p>
