title: "Croscon Beer Club Round 6: [Bridge and Tunnel Brewery](http://bridgeandtunnelbrewery.com/wordpress1/) (11/18)"
intro: |
  Pick some beer nuts, we're going in for round 7.

  Our last venture was likely our greatest since Transmitter. KCBC did
  everything but disappoint and contained some of the best brews we've ever
  gotten to sample. With 9 beers on tap and not a single one disappointing
  (special shoutout to Hipster Highway, the most drinkable beer I've had, and
  their amazing Octoberfest), it's high up on the list for a revisit.

  So, how do we top that?

  For our seventh trip, we're heading out to Queens (the weird part that hugs 
  the right side of Brooklyn) to [Bridge and Tunnel
  Brewery](http://bridgeandtunnelbrewery.com/wordpress1/).
