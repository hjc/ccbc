# The Croscon Beer Club

We all love beer, but some of us love it more than others, this is an event for those people.

## What is the Croscon Beer Club (CBC)?

The CBC is a joint initiative between Hayden and Chris to get the beer lovingest Crosconians to go out together
and experience the wonderful world of beer that NYC has to offer.

Some sample items:

- An evening at Brooklyn Brewery in Red Hook.
- Some delicious meats and beers at [Cannibal NYC](http://www.cannibalnyc.com/).
- McSorley's - the  oldest continuously runinng bar in the city.
