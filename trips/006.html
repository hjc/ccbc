        Last time we... errrr... I don't even know where we went. Some sort of
        homeless, post-Katrina New Orleans-esque shantytown that calls itself
        Greenpoint? Either way, we had some amazing brews! Including an
        excellent blueberry sour produced by the Kool-Aid man, a delicious
        Gose, some other pun-tastic beers, and some halfway decent spaetzle.

        What's in store this time?

      <hr />
      <p>
        For our sixth trip, we're headed back out to Brooklyn to hit up a
        newcomer: <a href="http://www.kcbcbeer.com/?age-verified=f9bed6e19e">
          Kings County Brewers Collective</a>. A small 15 barrel brewery that
        opened up in Bushwick this past year, with their taproom opening up
        sometime in September. They don't have a traditional focus, instead
        opting to brew their own, unique creations.
      </p>

      <p>
        KCBC has 9 beers on tap, all brewed by them. In addition to that, they
        have a "Local Talent Tap" which distributes beers brewed on their pilot
        system, very experimental, very fresh, and in collaboration with
        friends and neighbors. Their current line up looks quite delicious and
        varied, they've got a Kolsh, two Saisons, a few IPA's, and at least one
        sour. So, there should be something for everyone! Finally, they have
        "crowlers", their own take on growlers, this time in a can form
        (meaning you don't need to bring your own glass growler, or buy one, or
        take care of one, or clean one... fuck yea!). Unfortunately, food is
        not on the menu, but we have a few friends who live in the neighborhood
        (and one co-organizer who used to), so there shouldn't be any issue
        finding something tasty to eat once the drinking calms down!
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't think they do reservations, but they're open until 11pm, so if
        we show up around 6, we should easily be able to grab a table and drink
        the night away. Transportation options are either the M train or the
        L train (Myrtle Av. stop, or Jefferson St. stop, respectively) and
        should be simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        As always, we'll be leaving around 5:45-6pm and we'll be going on
        <b>Friday, October 28th</b>. Like last time, there's a "That's My Jam"
        that day (Elisha's), so if you intend to do both and have plenty of
        work, please plan around that!
      </p>

      <p>
        And, as always, everyone is welcome to join us, and so are friends and
        families. Please let me know if you're interested and I highly
        encourage you to come out! Next to Transmitter, this might be the trip
        I'm most excited for!

      <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I did this in HTML! It was... not THAT pleasant, but also not
            that bad!
          </li>
          <li>
            Styling courtesy of Bootstrap 3 (shocker)!
            <ul>
              <li>
                There are two custom styling rules on this page. They are:
                <code>
                  body {
                    padding: 10px;
                    max-width: 1024px;
                    vertical-align: middle;
                    display: table-cell;
                  }
                </code>
                and
                <code>
                  html {
                    display: table;
                    margin: auto;
                  }
                </code>
              </li>
              <li>
                To be fair, HTML is the KING of nested lists.
                <ul>
                  <li>I NEST ALL DAY SON!</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
              Yes, how easy and predictable nested lists are is how I judge
              a markup language.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I decided to stop putting this bullshit in gists and finally made
            a <a href="https://github.com/hjc1710/ccbc">repo</a>! Feel free to
            open issues or PR's adding new places for the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            I cannot TELL you how many times I've tried to just... use Markdown
            while writing this. You have spolied my MD.
