For the first event, Chris and I were thinking of going to [Transmitter Brewery](http://www.transmitterbrewing.com/) in
[Long Island City](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Transmitter+Brewing/@40.7402349,-73.9527002,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xca366f49bf73b052?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-c-Eiu7LAhWFvYMKHeltCcMQ_BIIfDAK)
and enjoying their local, homebrewed taps.

Yes, this will involve a ferry ride. Yes, Eli, this will be a longer ferry ride than last time. Yes, those are both positives.
The ferry is dope af.

We're thinking of setting the event for Friday, April 8th at 5 or 5:30 (the tasting room is from 5pm to 8pm).

We hope you all will join us and enjoy some tasty brews!

Let us know if you have any comments or suggestions! RSVP's or simple, "I'm in"'s are heavily appreciated!
